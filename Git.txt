Day-1 

What is Git? Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

---------------------------- Git HUB----------------------------
Day:2

Git Hub is remote repository where we are going to mainatain our source code

here we have two type of repositories we can create 

1. Public
2. Private 

public repository : everyone can read which means every one can clone but not write which means push

access required for that credentials or ssh keys 

private Repository: No one can clone untill has permissions of "ssh" after adding key only able to clone or pull from remote repository

git clone: we can clone entire repository in very first time if you are start the activity with that repository

git pull: we can pull chnages on top of the repository

git push : we can push our changes in to remote repository 

### To generate SSH Key

ssh-keygen (give this command into your terminal)

cd .ssh

copy the publickey id_rsa.pub

paste into github ssh keys 

settings-->ssh and GPG keys--> Add new ssh key and give any name and paste it your publickey over there 

start clone with ssh option
